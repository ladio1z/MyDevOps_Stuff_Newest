	1. Different Laptop model used  ==>  A vendor be contracted to provide a standarized Laptop brand based on the Company Working needs.
	2. Unlable Company's Laptop  ==> For easier identification of Laptop and inventory of the Company's Laptop, all Laptops should be assigned named/hostname.
	3. The four main stages of the hardware lifecycle should be enforce by the IT Department workng with the other department in the Company. Procurement and Deployment of Laptop  NOT by any other department ==> An Accepted OS should be used on all Company Laptop

As a Systems Administrator of Network Funtime Company, below are process improvements needed and why those improvements are needed:

1. The use of different laptop models -: For uniformity and easy identification of the Company's Laptops, future Company Laptops should be of a standardized Laptop brand that has the specification needed based on the Company Working needs. A vendor should be contracted to provide/procure these specified Laptops for the Company and should have a few of the Laptops in stock with the IT department. This will also prevent the current delay of the actual start day of new workers as any new employee will have an assigned laptop via the vendor.

2. Unlabeled of Company's Computers/Laptops -: All Company's Laptops/Computers should be assigned name/hostname and physically labeled on them, this is for easy identification of the Laptops/Computers and also keep inventory of the Company's Laptops/Computers.

3. The four main stages of the hardware lifecycle should be implemented by the IT Department working with the other departments in the Company. This is not so from the current status of the Company. This prevents room for cyberattacks on the Company network. Building the Operating System shouldn't be via USB but using a network-means provisioning build, through which a new machine will be built. 

4.  As a young Company and having not less revenue to spend, I advise the Company to move from Cloud Services to On-Premises Services, services such as word processors, spreadsheet applications, and applications for instant communication such as MS Teams can be accessed on-premises with lesser costs.

5.  From the current stage of the Company, Directory Services will be needed for employees' account creation as this will enable passwords to be reset for employee thus preventing reimagining one's machine when one's password can't be retrieved. The Directory Services will also enforce strict password 
requirement set for employees' login to their computers. 

6.  Orientation of new employees on their login to the assigned Laptops/Computers should be performed by the IT department and likewise the New employee email account should be performed by the IT department.

Scenarion 2:
Currently IT Infrastructure needs and limitations:
	1. Manually install lots of sales-specific applications
	2. Email Request on IT related Issues ==> Incident Ticketing Systems should 
	be implemented to keep track on the incidents and thier resolution made.
	3. All Software is kept in-house  ==> Single point of failure
	4. Customer Data stored on a single file server ===> Frequency Backup Customers's Data both 
	on On-premises and remote site (Increamental Backup and Full Backup)
	5. Access to Customer Data directory
	6. As the new employees will be hired; additional team members should be employed to the 
	IT team to handle other section of operations.
	7. Due on the Company's foreseen growth, I advice the Company's keen software be move 
	to cloud environment so its autoscale inline with its growth.

As a Systems Administrator of W.D. Widgets Company, below are process improvements needed and why those improvements are needed:

1.	The hours spent on provisioning a newly assigned machine to a new employee should be handled by using a network-means provisioning build, through which a new machine will be built. This will speed up the time of provisioning and hence provide more time for the IT person to do other tasks.

2.	An incident Ticketing System should be implemented to replace the Email requested to the IT person/department on IT-related issues. This implementation will help keep track of incidents and their resolution.

3.	In situations of a disaster such as a fire outbreak on the Company premises, the Company stands the risk of losing all this critical customer data and also the risk of business continuity as we can't access the Company's Software. There is a single point of failure in such a situation 
and there is the need to have secondary premises both hosting the Company's services/software and Company Customer Data. 

4.	As the Company Customer Data is stored on a single file server and in the likelihood of Data lost on a file server, how will the business be affected? We need to have a frequent backup of this Data both on On-Premises and on remote sites (a Cloud environment) using both Incremental Backup and Full Backup types.

5.	Policy should be set in accessing the Customer Data on the file server to prevent deletion of such Data and any deletion to this Data should be performed by a user with the right.

6.	As the new employees are expected to be hired in the coming year; additional team members should be employed to the IT team to handle sections of its growing operations. 

7.	Due to the Company's foreseen growth, I advise the Company's keen software to be moved to a Cloud environment so its autoscale in line with its growth.

Scenarion 3:
Currently IT Infrastructure needs and limitations:
	1.	Physical store bought based on arrival of employee due to budget ===> A vendor can be contacted to do so.
	2.	Leaving Employee's account not disabled in AD  ==> Disable the Employee account on AD using 
	a script (Automating it any time an employee left)
	3.	The difficulty of using the open-source ticketing system used by Company can be resolve by 
	the IT department undertaking a routine coauching of the usauage of the System and also make a
	handy manual on the usage of this Ticketing System be share with the other departments in the Company.
	4.	Backup Disk taken home daily  ==> Stand the risk of damage made to the disk which can lead to lost 
	of the data on it. Also have a remote site to backup the information there whiles having a Safe to keep
	the backup disk done onsite in. I advice the backup should be perform twice daily; in the morning performing full backup
	and evening performing increamental backup type.
	5.	The Company's website should be redesign using the current tools used for website design and should 
	be hosted on at least two instances of a virtual server.
	6.	Introduce a messaging System in the Company using tool such as Slack or Microsoft Teams Messaging Systems 
	to enable easy relaying of message between persons within the Company.

As a Systems administrator of Dewgood Company, below are process improvements needed and why those improvements are needed:

1.	As a small, local non-profit Company that purchase a new computer upon a new hired, I advice a vendor be contracted to undertake such tasks so as to enable the IT Officer/team to focus more directly on IT-related tasks.

2.	As accounts of resigned employees are currently not disable in the Windows Active Directory, this keep the Company at risk of violation by former employees or by cybercriminals to used this not disable account to have access to Company's resources or data. Those accounts of former employees should be disable on the AD using a script (Automating it) any time an employee left.

3.	The difficulty of using the open-source ticketing system used by Company can be resolve by the IT department undertaking a routine tutorial sessions of the usage of the System and also make a handy manual on the usage of this Ticketing System be share with the other departments in the Company.

4.	The daily movement of the Company's backup disk stand the risk of the disk getting stolen or broken, which can lead to lost of the data on it. A remote site to backup the Company's information should be set up
as a secondary backup whiles keeping the current backup disk (primary backup) in a Safe Box onsite. I advice the backup should be perform twice daily; in the morning performing full backup and in the evening performing incremental backup type. 
 
5.	The Company's website should be redesign using the current tools used for website design and should be hosted on at least two instances of a virtual server. The Company website can be used to inform and enable customers interreact with us instantly in regards to their requests. 

6.	Communication is one of the key to Company's growth and as there isn't a messaging system in place this makes relaying information to others very challenging. A messaging System should be introduce in the Company such as a Slack or Microsoft Teams Messaging Systems to enable easy relaying of message between persons within the Company.
