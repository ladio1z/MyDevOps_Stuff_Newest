How to install and Run Linux Software in Windows 10 usingWindows Sub System Linux WSL2?


What is WSL2?
Windows Subsystem for Linux is a compatibility layer for running Linux executables natively 
on Windows 10, 11, and Windows Server 2019, and we will install v2 of WSL i.e WSL2.


Prerequisites to setup WSL2 :

Windows 10 OS with version 1903 or higher or Windows 11 OS.
BIOS Level Virtualization support should be enabled, you can check it in 
Task Manager > Performance Tab

How to set up WSL2 in Windows 10?
Step 1: Enable WSL Feature.
To install WSL distros (Linux OS) we need to have the WSL feature enabled.

Open Powershell as Administrator and run the below command.
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart


Step 2: Enable Virtual Machine Platform.
WSL also depends on a Virtual Machine Platform, so we must enable it before installing the Linux distros (OS).

Open Powershell as Administrator and run the below command.
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart


Step 3: Restart Your PC
Restart your PC to make the above changes to become active.


Step 4: Download and install the Linux kernel update package.
Updating the WSL kernel package is recommended before installing Linux distros, you might face issues if this is not up to date.
By Installing wsl_update_x64.msi [ https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi ]


Step 5: Set v2 as the WSL default version.
WSL2 is preferred over version 1 for better performance.

wsl -l -v   # View version of wsl
wsl --set-default-version 2    # Set any version to 2
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2       # Set Ubuntu version to 2  [ wsl.exe --set-version (distro name) 2  ]


Step 6: Install Linux distribution (Ubuntu).
Now we can install the required Linux distros, here in this example where we are installing Ubuntu 20.04.

Open Powershell and run the below command.


wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04    
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

Once installation is completed, open “Ubuntu” from the start menu.
Set username(ladio1z), and password (UserLinux4WSL2) for WSL environment (Ubuntu).
To work on/as root on a WSL, on powershell type:  wsl -u root  
This login as root of the WSL on the machine.

Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.

Step 7: Run sample commands.

That’s it, we’ve done WSL setup and executed sample commands in Linux distribution in Windows 10 successfully.

[ If you're lucky, WSL2 should now be able to ] 
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade.

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
# This file was automatically generated by WSL. To stop automatic generation of this file, add the following entry to /etc/resolv.conf
# [network]
# generateResolvConf = false
nameserver xxx.xx.xx [ Change the nameserver value to 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1 and save the file.]


Open Command Prompt as an Administrator and type these commands:
wsl --shutdown
netsh winsock reset 
netsh int ip reset all
netsh winhttp reset proxy
ipconfig /flushdns

/*  optional
  netsh winsock reset
  shutdown /r
*/

Hit the Windows Key,
type Network Reset,
hit enter.
You should see this window.
Click "Reset now".
