CURL
cURL is a tool that allows us to transfer files from the shell over protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, FTPS, or SCP. 
This tool gives us the possibility to control and test websites remotely. 
Besides the remote servers' content, we can also view individual requests to look at the client's and server's communication.

curl http://localhost

Wget
An alternative to curl is the tool wget. 
With this tool, we can download files from FTP or HTTP servers directly from the terminal and serves as a good download manager. 
If we use wget in the same way, the difference to curl is that the website content is downloaded and stored locally, as shown in the following example.

wget http://localhost
