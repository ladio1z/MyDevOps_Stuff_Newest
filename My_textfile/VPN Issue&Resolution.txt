@CSD, 

Please advise the users to Reboot the device 7 times and try after 30 mins because each windows
 logon is an attempt to generate this PRT token, then run the CMD command “dsregcmd /status”

Reboot the device/computer 7 times and afterward wait for after 30 mins, then log in and try connecting to VPN

If that didn't work, Ask the user once logged into the laptop to connect to the recovery mode profile 
(connection to everything will be dropped since the Recovery VPN profile allows only a connection to AD and no other websites) 
- then disconnect again. Log out using Ctrl+Alt+Del and then sign in again.

If that didn't work then ask the user to go to the Windows logo - search for Credential manager -
 Remove all credentials in there - Press on Ctrl+Alt+Del - Sign out from the laptop - Sign in again.

If that didn't work then ask the user to log in to the laptop using full UPN (xxx@vodafone.com) and not (vf-root\shalabyk)

if the users followed the process and facing the same issue so please refer it to (GOIT WP OPS Client Management GOIT-WP)
